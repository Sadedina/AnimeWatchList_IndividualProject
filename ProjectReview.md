##### Sprint Review

In this sprint, I did not manage to finish all of my sprints backlog set. The completed User Stories for this sprint includes:

- Creating an ERD
- Creating a basic Fluid.ui
- Creating the Database
- Scaffolding the Database
- Set-Up of Visual Studio
- CRUD method for Profiles

Work to put back into Sprint Backlog: 

- User Register - WPF



### Sprint Retrospective

##### Mood: 8/10

Whilst completing the project during the day, my mood was high. as I felt the workload was not too much and I knew exactly what I needed to do.

##### Time Management: 2/3

I think my time management during the day could have been better. Spent more time than should have on the set-up of the User Stories, and I still have a lot of User Stories not clearly defined or relying on other stories.

#####  Work load: 2/3

I think the workload I set myself at the start of the day was achievable. However, I overlooked the fact that creating a working WPF might have been too much. All the worked would have been completed by the end of sprint 1 if I did not have to create a WPF.

##### Blockers: 1/3

In the current Sprint there were two main blockers:

The first issue was after I scaffolded my database and I created the basic set-up of my Visual Studio. I completed the first CRUD for the Profile database. However, when I tried inserting data into my database. There were 10 compiler errors, which could not locate files in the bin folder.

Resolved the issue by deleting the file and starting over again.

The Second issue was trying to keep the ProfileId encapsulated from the code and allowing the user to change their details without seeing an ID. However, every code I tried resulted in a query rather than an iteration.

This issue is still to be solved.

##### Next Step

I know what will help me achieve my goal set for each sprint is to have more communication with the Trainer and evaluating my performance on task throughout the day.
