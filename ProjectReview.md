##### Sprint Review

In this sprint, I did not manage to finish all of my sprints backlog set. The completed User Stories for this sprint includes:

- Creating an ERD
- Creating a basic Fluid.ui
- Creating the Database
- Scaffolding the Database
- Set-Up of Visual Studio
- CRUD method for Profiles

Work to put back into Sprint Backlog: 

- User Register - WPF



### Sprint Retrospective

##### Mood: 8/10

Whilst completing the project during the day, my mood was high. I felt the workload was not too much and I knew exactly what I needed to do.

##### Time Management: 2/3

I think my time management during the day could have been better. Spent more time than should have on the set-up of the User Stories, and I still have a lot of User Stories not clearly defined or relying on other stories.

#####  Work load: 2/3

I think the workload I set myself at the start of the day was achievable. However, I overlooked the fact that creating a working WPF might have been too much. All the worked would have been completed by the end of sprint 1 if I did not have to create a WPF.

##### Blockers: 1/3

In the current Sprint there were two main blockers:

The first issue was after I scaffolded my database and I created the basic set-up of my Visual Studio. I completed the first CRUD for the Profile database. However, when I tried inserting data into my database. There were 10 compiler errors, which could not locate files in the bin folder.

Resolved the issue by deleting the file and starting over again.

The Second issue was trying to keep the ProfileId encapsulated from the code and allowing the user to change their details without seeing an ID. However, every code I tried resulted in a query rather than an iteration.

This issue is still to be solved.

##### Next Step

I know what will help me achieve my goal set for each sprint is to have more communication with the Trainer and evaluating my performance on task throughout the day.

##### Sprint Review

In this sprint, I manage to finish all of my sprints backlog set. The completed User Stories for this sprint includes from Sprint 1:

- Register User through WPF
- Unique Username 

Work is currently in review as I still have to refactor the code and ensure it is all unit tested



### Sprint Retrospective

##### Mood: 5/10

Whilst completing the project during the day, my mood was average. Started off high as I was finishing the Crud functions (I knew exactly what to do). Then my mood fell low as I, I ran into different blockers which are explained below.

##### Time Management: 3/3

My time management was excellent today. This is because I did not set a lot of User Stories, due to me thinking on how to tackle the WPF implementation. I manage to start implement other CRUD functionality, which were not set into the sprint as I needed them in order to fully implement the WPF user stories.

#####  Work load: 2/3

The workload set was a little low for the day. This is because I thought implementing the WPF would take a lot of time. Which it did. However, I finished them on time for the end of the Sprint 2

##### Blockers: 1/3

In the current Sprint there were a lot of blockers:

Firstly, I solved the blockers of the previous day (changeable username with same personalId). This was solved by referencing the old username to change into the new username. This ensures the ID is completely encapsulated.

As I was trying to implementing the UI, I took reference from a previous code. The Visual Studio started showing errors saying a name did not have a reference, where the name was not even being used. The way I solved this was by restarting the project from scratch.

Before restarting from scratch I tried pulling the previous version from GitHub. However, I accidentally created a new branch, were I was not able to commit my new work to remote location. This was solved by creating a temp branch, merging and deleting them.

##### Next Step

I will try and set an adequate amount of work to do in Sprint 3. So I can maintain a high mood and finish my work on time for the end of the sprints.
